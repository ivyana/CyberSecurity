# Lab 9: CSRF Security

>The main goal of this lab work is to create a web application which would be protected from CSRF attacks.
CSRF attacks bring the most damage when executed by a logged user (especially an admin).
To implement mechanisms of protection from CSRF, first is needed to create a web application
that would allow a user to authenticate himself. After applying the defence mechanisms of
your choice, is needed to show their effectiveness.

### Required features:

- Create a web application where the user can authenticate;
- Implement CSRF protection for your web application;
- Prove the effectiveness of implemented mechanisms (I created a malicious script).


### Used Technologies:

- Windows 10 
- Python
- PyCharm
- Flask
- WTForms


### Instructions:

**1.Run app.py, open your localhost url and create a user:**

```
python app.py
```

**2. Run malicious script to check CSRF Security:**
```
malicious_script.html
```
